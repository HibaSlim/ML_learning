Exercise: Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic
Objective
You are working in a cybersecurity team and need to detect unusual network activity that could indicate a cyber attack. Your goal is to use unsupervised anomaly detection techniques to identify suspicious patterns in network traffic.

Dataset
Use the KDD Cup 99 dataset (or generate synthetic data) with features such as:

Duration (length of the connection)

Protocol Type (TCP, UDP, ICMP)

Service (HTTP, FTP, etc.)

Bytes Sent/Received

Connection Count (number of connections to the same destination in a short period)

You can download a similar dataset from Kaggle or create synthetic data.

Tasks
Load and Explore the Data

Load the dataset using Pandas.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization (histograms, box plots, etc.).

Preprocess the Data

Convert categorical features (e.g., Protocol Type) into numerical values.
Apply Clustering and Anomaly Detection
K-Means Clustering:

Use the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters.

Train K-Means and visualize clusters.

Agglomerative Clustering:

Try different linkage methods (ward, complete, average).

Use a scatterplot to determine the number of clusters.

KNN for Anomaly Detection:

Compute the distance to k-nearest neighbors and mark outliers (high distances).

Set a threshold to classify normal vs. anomalous traffic.

Visualize and Analyze Results
Plot network traffic data colored by clusters.

Compare cluster distributions across K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering.

Evaluate anomalies using KNN by analyzing data points with unusually high distances
